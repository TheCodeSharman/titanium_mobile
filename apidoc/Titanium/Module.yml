name: Titanium.Module
summary: Base type for all Titanium modules.
description: |
    A Titanium module is a Titanium object, or _proxy_, that can be accessed using a static
    identifier, such as `Titanium.API` or `Titanium.Map`. Titanium modules are singletons
    that provide access to properties, constants, and methods that must be accessed in a static 
    context. 

    For example, the <Titanium.UI> module provides constants and factory methods related
    to UI objects, as well as a few UI-related properties that are not related to a
    specific object.
