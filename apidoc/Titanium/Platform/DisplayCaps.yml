name: Titanium.Platform.DisplayCaps
summary: |
    The Display Caps object returned by the <Titanium.Platform.displayCaps> property.
description: |
    On iPhone, the `density` property is `high` for retina devices or `medium` otherwise, 
    and the `dpi` property is `320` or `160` otherwise.

    On iPad, the `density` property is `medium` and the `dpi` property is `130`.
    
    Note that the `displayCaps` property begins with a lowercase letter, which differentiates it 
    from the `DisplayCaps` object that it returns. Refer to the example to understand how it should 
    be called.

    summary: |
        Logical density of the display, as a scaling factor for the Density Independent Pixel (dip) 
        unit.
    description: |
        One dip is one pixel on a 160dpi display, approximately, with a 240x320, 1.5"x2" display
        providing a baseline. For example, for a 160dpi display, this value will be 1, and for 120dpi, 
        it will be .75.
        
        This value does not precisely follow the real display size, as given by `xdpi` and `ydpi`, 
        but instead is used to scale the size of the overall UI in steps based on changes in the 
        display dpi. For example, a 240x320 screen will have a density of 1, whether its width is 
        1.8" or 1.3". However, if the resolution is increased to 320x480 but the display remains 
        1.5"x2" then the density would be increased to about 1.5.

        The system's screen dimensions can be obtained using the following code.

            var width = Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformWidth;
            var height = Titanium.Platform.displayCaps.platformHeight;
