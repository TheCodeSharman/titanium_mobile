        Calling `stop` halts the current execution of the background service, but does *not* 
        unregister it. The service will run again the next time the application is placed in
        the background.
  - name: unregister
    summary: Unregisters the background service.

    The BackgroundService is created by <Titanium.App.iOS.registerBackgroundService>. When
    creating a background service, you specify a local URL to a JavaScript file. The code
    in the JavaScript file is executed each time the background service runs.

    The background service runs when the Application is placed in the background and will 
    continue to run until the service is stopped with the `stop` method or the `unregister` method.
    
    Stopping a running background service will conserve resources while it's running in the 
    background. However, if the application is foregrounded and then backgrounded again, it 
    will run again.  If you want to permanently stop running the background service, you must 
    call `unregister`.
