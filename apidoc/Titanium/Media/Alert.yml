name: Titanium.Media.Alert
summary: An object for playing system sounds.
description: |
    You can use this module to provide audible alerts. 

    You can use it to play short (30 seconds or shorter) sounds. The interface does not provide level, positioning, 
    looping, or timing control, and does not support simultaneous playback: You can play only one sound at a time. 

    This module differs from the Sound module because it honors the ringtone volume, not the Music volume.

    Use the <Titanium.Media.createAlert> method to create a `Alert` object.
