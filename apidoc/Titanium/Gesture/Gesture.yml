events:
  - name: orientationchange
    summary: Fired when the device orientation changes.
    description: |
        On Android, note that the application must have a heavyweight window or tab group open 
        in order to receive the `orientationchange` event. It is not necessary for the  heavyweight
        window to be the topmost window.

        Almost all real-world applications will have a heavyweight windows or a
        tab group. This is only likely to be an issue if you create a test case or test
        application that adds an orientation change listener from `app.js`
        without opening a heavyweight window.

        Android and Mobile Web do not support the "reverse" orientations,
        `UPSIDE_PORTRAIT` and `LANDSCAPE_RIGHT`.
