name: Titanium.UI.iOS.FeedbackGenerator
summary: |
    The feedback generator API is introduced in iOS 10 to handle the haptic engine feedback when using an iPhone 7
    and later.
description: |
    There are three different kind of feedback generators that can be used for different interaction scenarios:
      * Selection feedback: Used to receive a haptic feedback to the user when selecting a certain control. This feedback
      type can be used when specifying the <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_TYPE_SELECTION> constant in the `type` property
      of the feedback generator.
      * Impact feedback: Used to receive a haptic feedback to the user when a special impact occurred to the user. This feedback
      type can be used when specifying the <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_TYPE_IMPACT> constant in the `type` property
      of the feedback generator. Note that if you use this generator type, you also have to specify the `style` property
      that can be one of the <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_IMPACT_STYLE_LIGHT>, <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_IMPACT_STYLE_MEDIUM>
      or <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_IMPACT_STYLE_HEAVY> constant.
      * Notification feedback: Used to receive a haptic feedback to the user when a notification is received. This feedback
      type can be used when using the <Ti.UI.iOS.FEEDBACK_GENERATOR_TYPE_NOTIFICATION> constant in the `type` property
      of the feedback generator.
