    summary: A banner view action can cover your application's user interface. However, your application continues to run, and receives events normally. If your application receives an event that requires the user's attention, it can programmatically cancel the action and uncover its interface by calling cancelAction. Canceling actions frequently can cause a loss of revenue for your application.

    description: |
        Apple only allows setting ad views as specific sizes, meaning that
        traditional view sizing is not allowed for ad views. Ads always
        display in full-screen mode when a user clicks on them - this
        size is for the "minimized" ad only. Should be set to either
        [AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT](Ti.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_PORTRAIT) or
        [AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE](Ti.UI.iOS.AD_SIZE_LANDSCAPE).
