    A Stepper displays its selected state while it is being pressed.
    You can specify background images for each state on iOS.
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createstepper> method or a **`<stepper>`** Alloy element to create a stepper 
    (see [Examples](#!/api/Titanium.UI.stepper-examples)) .

    * When assigning a custom image to the `backgroundImage` property, the image must be
    partially or wholly transparent for the background color or background gradient to be visible.
    * Similarly, for an assigned background gradient to show through, the `backgroundColor` may need to be
    set to 'transparent'.

    *Note that the stepper cannot be re-sized.

properties:

  - name: value
    summary: The current value of the stepper.
    type: Number

  - name: continous
    summary: |
        If YES, value change events are sent immediately when the value changes during user interaction.
        If NO, a value change event is sent when user interaction ends.
        The default value is YES.
    type: Boolean

  - name: autorepeat
    summary: |
        If YES, the user pressing and holding on the stepper repeatedly alters value.
        The default value is YES.
    type: Boolean

  - name: wraps
    summary: |
        If YES, incrementing beyond maximumValue sets value to minimumValue; likewise, decrementing below
        minimumValue sets value to maximumValue. If NO, the stepper does not increment beyond maximumValue nor
        does it decrement below minimumValue but rather holds at those values.
        The default value is NO.
    type: Boolean

  - name: minimumValue
    summary: The miniumum value the stepper will be set to, the value must be smaller than the maximumValue.
    type: Number

  - name: minimumValue
    summary: The maximum value the stepper will be set to, the value must be greater than the miniumumValue.
    type: Number

  - name: minimumValue
    summary: The value the stepper will decrement and increment by.
    type: Number

  - name: tintColor
    summary: Sets the color for the widget, any backgroundImages added will be set to the same color.
    description: |
        Default color is blue
        For information about color values, see the "Colors" section of <Titanium.UI>.
    type: String

  - name: backgroundImage
    summary: |
        Background image for the stepper in its normal state, specified as a local file path or URL.
    description: |
        Also sets the background image for other stepper states (focused, selected),
        unless they've been specified explicitly. On iOS, if backgroundDisabledImage is unset, the
        image will appear faded to indicate being disabled. Also on iOS, if backgroundSelectedImage
        is unset, the image will be darkened to indicate being selected.
    type: String

  - name: backgroundDisabledImage
    summary: |
        Background image for the stepper in its disabled state, specified as a local file path
        or URL. 
    description: |
        Also sets the background image for the other stepper states (normal, focused, selected), 
        unless they've been specified explicitly, except for iOS, which requires a backgroundImage.
    type: String
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, mobileweb]

  - name: backgroundSelectedImage
    summary: |
        Background image for the stepper in its selected state, specified as a local file 
        path or URL.
    type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: decrementImage
    summary: |
        Background image for the stepper decrement button in its normal state, specified as a local
        file path or URL.

        Also sets the background image for the other stepper states (disabled, focused, selected),
        unless they've been specified explicitly, except for iOS, which requires a backgroundImage.
    type: String

  - name: decrementDisabledImage
    summary: |
        Background image for the stepper decrement button in its dissabled state, specified as a local
        file path or URL.
    type: String
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: decrementSelectedImage
