name: Titanium.UI.iOS.Toolbar
summary: An iOS toolbar, which can contain buttons and certain other controls.
description: 
    Note that toolbars are positioned like other views (using the `top` and `bottom properties, 
    for example), but the iOS Human Interface Guidelines have specific requirements for
    placing toolbars: on iPhone, a toolbar should be at the bottom 
    of the window. On the iPad, a toolbar can appear on the top or bottom of a window.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.iOS.createToolbar> method to create a toolbar.
