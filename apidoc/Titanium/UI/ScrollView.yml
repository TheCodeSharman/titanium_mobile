name: Titanium.UI.ScrollView
summary: |
    A view that contains a horizontally and/or vertically-scrollable region of content.  
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollView> method to create a scroll view.
    
    Views added to the scroll view will be scrolled based on the size of the scrollable region of 
    content. If a scrollable region fits within the size of its scroll view, the view will not 
    scroll.

    #### Android
    
    On Android, a scroll view can only scroll in one direction, either vertical or horizontal, 
    and not both at the same time. Hence, the <Titanium.UI.ScrollView.scrollType> property may be 
    used to set the scroll direction explicitly.
    
    If the `scrollType` property is not defined, the scroll view attempts to deduce the scroll 
    direction based on some of the other properties that have been set. Specifically, if 
    `contentWidth` and `width` are both set and are equal to each other, or if they are both set 
    *and* `showVerticalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction is set to 
    "vertical".  If `contentHeight` and `height` are both set and are equal, or if they are both 
    set and `showHorizontalScrollIndicator` is set to `true`, then the scroll direction is set 
    to "horizontal".  If `scrollType` is set, it overrides the deduced setting.
