name: Titanium.UI.AlertDialog
summary: |
    An alert dialog is a modal view that displays a title, message and one or more buttons for users 
    to choose between.
description: |
    An alert dialog is created using <Titanium.UI.createAlertDialog>.

    A global method `alert()` is aliased to this object, and can be invoked with a single message. 
    For example
    
        alert('this is a message');
        
    This will generate an alert with a title of "Alert" and an "OK" button.
    
    Multiple alerts should not be shown at once once.

    Although this dialog appears in the middle of the display (not touching the 
    edges) other aspects of the aesthetics, behavior and the way the user interacts with it is 
    different for each platform, as described below.

    #### Android
    
    On Android, the default alert dialog displays text information, via a title and message, without 
    any buttons. As the user can use the system hardware `back` button to dismiss it, a button is 
    not mandatory.
    
    Buttons are shown if the `buttonNames` property is defined, and are rendered horizontally below 
    the message.
    
    Other views may be added to 
    #### iOS
    
    On iOS, the default alert dialog displays text information, via a title and message, with 
    a single button, used to dismiss it.
    
    Buttons are shown if the `buttonNames` property is defined, and are rendered vertically below 
    the message.
    
    On iOS 4, alert dialogs will automatically be cancelled upon application suspend.
