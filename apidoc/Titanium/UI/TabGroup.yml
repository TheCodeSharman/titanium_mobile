name: Titanium.UI.TabGroup
summary: A tabbed group of windows.
description: |
    The Tab Group allows you to manage a tabbed UI of one or more windows. 
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createTabGroup> method to create a tab group.

    A tab group can contain one or more [Tab](Titanium.UI.Tab) objects, each of which 
    has an associated tab button and a stack of windows. The user can switch between
    tabs by tapping a tab button. 

    Programmatically, you can specify the active tab by calling [setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) on
    the tab group or by setting the [active](Titanium.UI.Tab.active) property on one of the tabs.
    
    Note that when opening a tab group, if one or more of its tabs are set 
    'active' *prior* to opening, or if `setActiveTab()` is called while 
    a tab is 'active', the result of which tab is initially selected is 
    undefined.

    When using a tab group, note the following differences between platforms: 
    on Android, tabs cannot be removed from the tab group once added, and the 
    tabs cannot be reordered. On iOS, tabs can be removed, and the user may (optionally) 
    be allowed to reorder tabs.
