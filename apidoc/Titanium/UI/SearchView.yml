name: Titanium.UI.SearchView
summary: A specialized text field for entering search text.
description: |
    A widget that provides a user interface for the user to enter a search query and submit a request to a search provider.
    
    Search views are most commonly used for filtering the rows in a [TableView](Titanium.UI.TableView).
    Similar to [SearchBar](Titanium.UI.SearchBar), you can add a search view to a table view by setting the table view's 
    [search](Titanium.UI.TableView.search) property. 
    
    You can also add search view in an action bar as an action view.

    A search view can be used without a table view.

    Use the <Titanium.UI.createSearchView> method to create a search view.
