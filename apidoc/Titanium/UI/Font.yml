  - name: fontSize
    summary: Font size, in platform-dependent units.
    description: Font size. iOS accepts sizes in Apple "points," where one "point" corresponds to one pixel on non-Retina displays, and two pixels on Retina displays. The default unit on Android is pixels, but users can specify other units, including pixels (px), points (pt), density-independent pixels (dp or dip), millimeters (mm) or inches (in). For example, "16dp" specifies a size of 16 density-independent pixels. Note that points on Android refers to the typographical unit of 1/72 of an inch, not to be confused with Apple "points."
