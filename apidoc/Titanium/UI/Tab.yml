name: Titanium.UI.Tab
summary: A tab instance for a [TabGroup](Titanium.UI.TabGroup).
description: |
    A `TabGroup` tab instance. Each tab includes a button and one or more windows, which 
    holds the "contents" of the tab. Users can select a tab by clicking on the tab button.

    Use [TabGroup.setActiveTab](Titanium.UI.TabGroup.setActiveTab) to switch between tabs 
    in a tab group. The <Titanium.UI.currentTab> property provides a global reference to 
    the currently active tab. Use the <Titanium.UI.createTab> method to create a tab.
    
    #### Platform Implementation Notes
    The behavior of tabs and tab groups follows the platform's native navigation style, 
    which varies significantly between platforms.

    On iOS, the tab maintains a stack of windows. Windows on top of the stack can partially 
    or totally obscure windows lower in the stack.  Calling [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) 
    opens a new window on top of the window stack. When a window is closed, either by the 
    user or by code, the window is removed from the stack, making the previous window 
    visible. The root tab window cannot be removed. On iOS the tab controls are generally 
    kept on screen to allow a user to navigate inside the app. Tab controls are hidden 
    when the user is performing a modal task (for example, composing a message). In this case,
    the app should open the new window as modal and provide a button in the navigation 
    bar to return to the previous screen.

    On Android, calling [open](Titanium.UI.Tab.open) opens a new, heavyweight window, which 
    by default covers the tab group entirely. This seems quite different from the iOS model,
    but it is the standard model for Android applications. Users can use the **Back** button 
    to return to the tab group.

        In this example, we create a simple tab and add it to a tab group.
        
            var tab = Titanium.UI.createTab({
            	window:mywin,
            	title:'Hello',
            	icon:'myicon.png'
            });
            tabGroup.addTab(tab);
