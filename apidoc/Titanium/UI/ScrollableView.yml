name: Titanium.UI.ScrollableView
summary: |
    A view that encapsulates a horizontally-scrolling set of sub-views, navigable using its built-in 
    horizontal swipe gestures.
description: |
    Use the <Titanium.UI.createScrollableView> method to create a scrollable view.

    Scrollable View supports a visual paging control that may be enabled to indicate on-screen that 
    a view is visible.
    
    Only the `scroll` event exists on Android. To support those that are missing, event listeners 
    may be added to its child views.

events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against this view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly without moving their 
        finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, moves their finger, and 
        then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.
