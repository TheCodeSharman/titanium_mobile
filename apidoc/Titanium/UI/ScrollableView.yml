name: Titanium.UI.ScrollableView
summary: |
    The Scrollable View is created using the <Titanium.UI.createScrollableView> 
    method, enabling a horizontally-scrolling set of sub-views.
description: |    
    Scrollable View is navigable using its in-built left-right/right-left swipe 
    gestures. It optionally supports a visual paging control, to indicate 
    on-display that a view is visible.
    
    This view supports most event types on iOS, whereas only `scroll` is 
    supported on Android. To support any that are missing, event listeners may 
    be added to its child views.

events:
  - name: click
    summary: Fired when the device detects a click against the view.
    description: |
        There is a subtle difference between singletap and click events.

        A singletap event is generated when the user taps the screen briefly
        without moving their finger. This gesture will also generate a click event.

        However, a click event can also be generated when the user touches, 
        moves their finger, and then removes it from the screen.

        On Android, a click event can also be generated by a trackball click.

    summary: Fired when the device detects a long press.
    description: |
        A long press is generated by the user touching and holding on a touchscreen.
        The event occurs before the finger is lifted again.  Both a `longpress`
        and a `longclick` can occur together.  The differences are that `longclick` 
        can be generated with the trackball whereas `longpress` is a touch-only event, 
        and `longpress` includes `x` and `y` coordinates.
